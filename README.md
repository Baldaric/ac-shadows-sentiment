# 🎮 Shadows of Opinion: A Sentiment Analysis of Assassin's Creed Shadows

## 🎯 Project Overview
Assassin’s Creed Shadows received a “Very Positive” rating on Steam (81%), but that number alone lacks context. This project explores player sentiment more deeply—analyzing what aspects were praised or criticized using over 9,000 Steam reviews.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Aggregated scores do not show **why** players feel positively or negatively about the game. This project aims to:
- Classify review sentiment using contextual NLP models.
- Identify frequently mentioned gameplay elements.
- Track how sentiment changes over time.
- Visualize key insights for players and developers.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Topic extraction (e.g., stealth, bugs, characters)
- Time-based trend analysis from launch onward
- Visual storytelling through word clouds, distributions, and timelines

---

## 📚 Data Source
- **Steam Reviews** (Scraped using the `steamreviews` package)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Data Collection**: `steamreviews`, `requests`
- **Sentiment Analysis**: `BERT`

- Cleaned dataset & Jupyter notebook
- GitHub repository with visual assets

## 📎 Project Motivation
As a long-time Assassin's Creed fan, I created this project to explore how players truly feel about the franchise's latest installment—beyond the surface-level score.
