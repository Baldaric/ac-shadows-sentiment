🎯 Project Title:
"Shadows of Opinion: A Sentiment Analysis of Assassin's Creed Shadows Across Platforms"

🧩 Problem Statement:
While Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently holds a "Very Positive" rating on Steam (81%), this aggregated score lacks depth. The goal is to uncover detailed, topic-specific, and temporal sentiment trends surrounding the game—across multiple platforms (Steam, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, etc.).

🔍 Project Goals:
Classify sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) from user-generated content.

Extract specific themes (e.g., stealth mechanics, characters, setting, bugs).

Track sentiment over time (e.g., from first trailer to release and beyond).

Compare sentiments across platforms (Steam vs Reddit vs Twitter).

Visualize insights to support players, developers, and analysts.

📚 Data Sources:
Steam Reviews (scraped using steamreviews or beautifulsoup)

Reddit Posts/Comments

Subreddits: r/assassinscreed, r/games, r/gaming

Use PRAW or Pushshift API

Twitter/X

Use Tweepy or Twitter API v2

YouTube Comments

Trailer or dev update videos using YouTube Data API

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Data Collection: requests, BeautifulSoup, PRAW, Tweepy, youtube_dl, steamreviews

Text Processing: nltk, spaCy, re, langdetect, emoji

Sentiment Analysis:

Basic: TextBlob, VADER (good for social media/short text)

Advanced: BERT (with transformers, for context-aware sentiment)

Topic Modeling: LDA, BERTopic

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, wordcloud, streamlit (for dashboards)

🧠 Workflow:
Data Collection & Cleaning

Remove duplicates, translate non-English, clean HTML tags/emojis

Sentiment Labeling

Classify each comment/post into Positive / Neutral / Negative

Keyword Extraction & Topic Modeling

Identify key topics: characters, story, combat, visuals, performance

Time Series Sentiment

Compare sentiment from trailer launch → gameplay reveal → release → patches

Cross-Platform Comparison

Are Steam users more positive than Redditors? Are Twitter users more critical?

Optional: Review Bomb Detection

Use timestamps and sudden spikes in review count or negativity

Sentiment trends over time

Word clouds by sentiment class

Platform comparison chart

Topic-based sentiment breakdown

PDF report or Medium-style blog post with key insights
